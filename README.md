### Import data

Data is imported from a file (trendpy only supports csv for now).

```markdown

# import data from csv file (with dates and price) -- for now trendpy only
# support 1D time series

  filename='snp500.csv'
  data = TimeSeries.from_csv(filename)
# plots time series
  data.plot()

```

### Trend filtering

There are 4 trend filters possible

* L2 (or Hodrick-Prescott) filter
* L1 filter
* L1-T filter
* L1-C filter

and two possible optimisation methods:

* interior-point
* MCMC

```markdown

# trend filter with selected filter

  data.filter('hp_filter',optimisation=true)
  data.plot(trend=true)

```
