### Import data

Data is imported from a file (trendpy only supports csv for now).

```markdown

# import data from csv file (with dates and price) -- for now trendpy only
# support 1D time series

from trendpy.timeseries import TimeSeries

filename='data.csv'
fund=TimeSeries.from_csv('data.csv')
fund.filter(number_simulations=30, burns=10)

# plots time series
fund.plot()

```

### Trend filtering

There are 4 trend filters possible

* L1 filter
* L2 filter (or Hodrick-Prescott filter)
* L1-C filter
* L2-C filter

and two possible optimisation methods:

* interior-point
* MCMC

```markdown

# trend filter with selected filter

  data.filter('hp_filter',optimisation=true)
  data.plot(trend=true)

```

# Requirements

These requirements reflect the testing environment.  It is possible
that trendpy will work with older versions.
